Hi, I'm Alex LaPrade. I’m currently a product manager at [Dispatch](http://dispatch.me).  Previously, I was a product manager at Angie’s List. While I was there, I worked on 

* the SnapFix iOS app / Android app / web widget
* the core Angie's List iOS/Android mobile apps
* internal tools / internal API's
* service provider apps (ServiceTown) and integrations 
* the fulfillment (of home services jobs)
* analytics

I occasionally write about product - which means everything from software development, analytics, design, QA, etc. - things I wish I knew when I started out.

Most of what I publish starts as something I've written + shared interally at Dispatch and end up publicly publishing here later on.

I also read a lot.
