Hi, I'm Alex. I’m currently a product manager at ![Dispatch](http://dispatch.me).  Previously, I was a product manager at Angie’s List and worked on SnapFix, Mobile, Fulfillment and analytics.

I also ![read](/book-notes/) a lot.

This blog is built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), hosted by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and uses CloudFlare.
