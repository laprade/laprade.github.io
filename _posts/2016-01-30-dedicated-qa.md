title: You’ll reap the benefit of dedicated QA sooner than you think

As with most things, if you don’t think you need role XYZ, you just haven’t seen [greatness](http://joekraus.com/if-you-dont-think-you-need-it-you-havent-seen-greatness) yet.

A (past) belief that I developed was that you DON'T need dedicated QA. That’s partly because I hadn’t seen greatness yet - I had only seen quality implemented poorly.

A bug would be shipped to production, and the immediate blame would be pointed at the team’s dedicated QA resource. Shame on you for not catching that bug!

The engineer who wrote the code and the engineer(s) who reviewed the code escaped any blame or sense of wrongdoing. This led to a belief that you don’t need QA. Between engineering and product, you should own your shit, so people have a sense of accountability.

Boy was I wrong. I’ve pulled a 180 and am completely aboard the school of thought that you’ll reap the benefit of dedicated QA sooner than you think.

It boils down to enabling smaller, higher quality releases (and shipping code = addicting to your team).

- When you plan your future sprints out (or just the upcoming one), you start to think in releases and constantly prepping release candidates. Smaller releases are key (obvious statement).

- You avoid the scenario of an engineer or PM saying "I don’t want to run regression so let’s bundle this one more thing in to prevent duplicate effort.” Suddenly your release candidate has grown in size, and you’re further between times you’re releasing.

- Instead of testing being one of someone’s many priorities ("I’m not sure if I can get through running full regression in order to release tomorrow"), it’s someone's only focus: getting your release candidates out the door.

All of the above have led to us shipping code faster that’s also higher quality.
