title: What makes a great PM?
permalink: great-pm
---

I've learned a lot about what it takes to be a great [recruiter](/recruiting) in the past year, but the one role that has been tougher than any other to hire for has been fellow product managers. I think that comes down to:

(a) as a skill, [building] product is such a vague dark art and

(b) confusion about WTF does a product manager actually does (which varies wildly from company to company)

I used to maintain a much longer list in Evernote that included every possible skill or characteristic a PM could have (along with reference links to what other people thought).  Over time, I've developed my own answer to "what makes a great PM?" and realized that only three things really matter (and you could just start and end with #1).

## 1. "Just win, baby" -Al Davis

You should absolutely celebrate the small wins. However, product teams exist to move key metrics & objectives for your business. Great PM's build product that moves these metrics and "wins games" for their company.

It's an analogy I first read/heard from [Adam Nash](http://www.slideshare.net/adamnash/be-a-great-product-leader-airbnb-2013).

PM's should hold their hat to the final product (and its success or failure), not the process or whose ideas got the product to where it is. 

There's a difference between building the best product and building a "winning" product.

## 2. Build the "right thing"

> Make something people want
-[Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/good.html)

It's obvious and PM 101.

After all, as the cliche quote goes, there's no amount of marketing or growth hacking that will grow a product that no one wants (or solves a problem no one has).

There are a number of ways of figuring out what the "right" thing is (which we don't need to go over now). It's not important how you figure it out. 

All that matters is that you build the "right" thing because building the "wrong" thing is the least efficient thing you can do. You would actually be better off doing nothing than building the "wrong" thing.

Besides the opportunity cost of what you could have built...

- it's one more feature you have to maintain
- one more thing to cover in regression testing for every subsequent release
- one more potential fault point where something could break during development
- one more decision for users to make (affecting their cognitive overhead), and
- eventually, the work to "unlaunch"/sunset this unsuccessful feature

## 3. Help the team go faster

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></center>

Obviously, it doesn't matter how fast you're going if you're building the wrong thing (see above). Or if you're late, and someone has already "won" the market. 

While we all strive to build the best products, the best products don't always win (top of mind given the recent shutdown of [Carousel & Mailbox](http://recode.net/2015/12/07/in-retrenchment-dropbox-closes-down-mailbox-and-carousel-photo-services/)). It doesn't matter if you've built the best product ever if all your users have already churned out of frustration with your past product.

Speed matters for "winning". It matters for organizational morale. It matters when you have a limited runway and day zero looming in the future.
