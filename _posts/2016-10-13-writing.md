title: (DRAFT) The Value of Writing
permalink: writing

_Apps have betas, so why can’t blog posts have “draft” status while they are WIP?_


Anyone who has been around me has probably seen me share a Dropbox Paper link or use a document to lead a meeting/converation (those occasionally are what ended up posted here). Why do I do this?

It's driven by three people I greatly admire: Andy Grove, Ben Horowitz, and Jeff Bezos but boils down to:

1. Communication is a skill that you only get better with with practice.
2. Writing forces clarity of thinking.


## Andy Grove

> As they are written and formulated, the author is forced to be more precise than he might be verbally.  Hence their value stems from the discipline and the thinking the writer is forced to impose upon himself as he identifies and deals with trouble spots in his presentation.  Reports are more a medium of self-discipline than a way to communicate information.  Writing the report is important; reading it often is not.

### Ben Horowitz

> Written communication to engineering is superior [to verbal communication] because it is more consistent across an entire product team, it is more lasting, it raises accountability."

## Jeff Bezos

> There is no way to write a six-page, narratively structured memo and not have clear thinking.

> But some form of regular writing is one of the best ways to give yourself time for reflection and analysis. It could be any kind of writing. Consider Jeff Bezos’s approach to meetings. Whoever runs the meeting writes a memo no longer than six pages about the issue at hand. Then, for the first 15 to 30 minutes of the meeting, the group reads it. The rest of the meeting is spent discussing it. No PowerPoint allowed. Brilliant.
