title: Don't build features, solve problems

All too often when you look at a roadmap, it's a pretty chart with a list of features and dates oriented around answering "what features/things are we building next?"

Similarly, too many user feedback forms are focused asking "what features are we missing?" or "what feature would you like to see?"

It's as if one additional feature is going to be the difference between a user churning and not.

I believe the better question(s) we all should be asking is: **"What problem should we solve next?"**

Your roadmap shouldn't be a list of all the features you're going to build next.  It should be problem-driven and oriented around which problems you're going to solve next.

_Yes, (at [Dispatch](http://dispatch.me)), we maintain two roadmaps: one has a list of features for external communication. The second roadmap is an internal roadmap of which user problems we're solving next._

### How do you figure out if this the right problem to be solving?

It's a very imprecise science. Here are the (blatantly obvious) questions I always find myself asking:

- Is this a problem that all of our users have?
- ... that all of our users encounter all the time?
- How much pain does this problem currently cause our users?

If we are thinking about our users' problems on the infamous [Des Traynor](https://twitter.com/destraynor) chart about building for '[all of the people, all of the time](http://calacanis.com/2015/02/02/what-product-features-should-i-focus-on/)', there should be a third piece of information architecture with the size of the pain this problem currently causes our product's users (or potential users).

### Why framing & communicating the problem is important

- Above all else, it gets the entire team rallying around finding the best solution(s) to your users' problems; not just building features and shipping code.  The hope is that many minds are better than one when it comes to solving the right problems, not just blindly building solutions that a PM had in mind and brought to the team to execute.
- One of the most common questions from engineers "why are doing this?" is not only handled but embraced.
- If you abide by the belief that "design is communication" - the design (what's important, what action do you want a user to take) is oriented around solving the users' problem.

The first question when receiving feedback or a feature request should always be "what problem is this solving?" Most feature requests are proposed solutions without articulating the problem solved.

One of the side effects of feature-based roadmaps is the urge to add more surface area to the product versus focusing on how well you are solving the one or two core problems that your product solves and [improving](https://twitter.com/sean_a_rose/status/573014612938899456) it.  Shiny new feature X is much sexier on a roadmap than version 3.0 of Existing Feature Y.

One of the most common reactions to "competitor" X building sexy feature Y (bonus points if it was announced in [TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com)) is: OMG, we need to completely reprioritize our roadmap to build this feature now too. However, it's easy to lose sight of the fact you're not really competing against "competitor" X.

What you're actually competing against is how your (potential) customers are currently solving their problem(s) and those customers continuing to solve that problem in the same way they currently are.  They don't care if their problem is solved through software or not.  They just want their problem solved.

At the end of the day, it's important to remember that a PM's job (building product) is about solving problems - not building features or having control over the direction of the product.

One of the best mindsets I've come across is from [Kyle Wild](https://twitter.com/dorkitude) @ Keen.io: [the best growth hack is your product](http://www.slideshare.net/kylewild/kyle-wildtokyoproductistheultimategrowthhack), and it's impossible to find a great product that doesn't solve a user's problem.
