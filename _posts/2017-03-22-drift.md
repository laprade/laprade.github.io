# What Drift is actually building
* The inevitable Drift vs Messenger collision
* A rough guess at what Drift is actually building

I initially jotted this down after this tweet but have shared the private Quip enough times, I'll just publish it:

Apologies for some of the rough graphics.

To be fair, Drift(t) is a company I never really understood.

As an outsider, it initially looked like they were just building an Intercom clone.

Although, recently it seemed to click, so here's ,y best guess (from an outsider's perspective with no private knowledge/insight).

Two trends to call out first...

## 1/ Messaging didn't start on mobile, but it has become the pervasive and dominant UX on mobile.

This is actually an info graphic published by Drift themselves.

## 2/ ... and chat is infiltrating how we communicate at work on a day to day basis

Slack hit 4 million daily users October 2016 and announced hitting [5 million in January 2017](https://venturebeat.com/2017/04/11/slack-passes-5-million-daily-users-and-launches-in-message-drop-down-menus-for-apps/).

But it's not just Slack, Microsoft Teams (launched March 14) has [85mm commercial customers](https://betanews.com/2017/03/20/teams-v-slack/) (as part of O365).

Ok, so here's what I think their master plan is:

## 1/ Their initial "live chat" widget just served two purposes



* Take over real estate in the bottom right corner on websites. There's only room for one chat widget in that part of the site, so it's a land grab with Intercom, etc.
* Start collecting data on what are the most common things that people chat about, which is openly talked about [here](https://blog.drift.com/schedule-a-meeting/).

## 2/ Understanding the "jobs" (in the "jobs to be done" sense of the word) of SMB websites.

Here are some of the primary "jobs" of SMB websites.

* Always on 24-7 service for potential customers to answer questions.
* Collect information about potential leads (e.g. forms)
* Schedule demos (SaaS) or appointments (like haircuts)

Bots start to replace these jobs as iterative improvements.

e.g.

Marketing was the starting point since it's the easiest to calculate ROI for (e.g. qualifying leads). I know the cost to schedule a demo.

## 3/ Bots start to take over the jobs of websites

As these "bots" get built, it's becoming more and more clear that they are taking over the "jobs" of websites.

* [Lead Bot](https://www.drift.com/leadbot/) is the first "job" of a website that Drift is taking over an existing job.
* [Schedule bot](https://blog.drift.com/schedule-a-meeting/) is starting out with scheduling demos before allowing consumers to book inside a chat experience like OpenTable, StyleSeat, etc.

"Jobs" (the things we are trying to accomplish) don't change but solutions do - e.g.

// insert example job

## 4/ Eventually the bots from Drift swallow all the jobs of an SMB website

Why search through a website and click around? If you think that consumers come to websites to ask questions, why can't I just format in a question to a bot?

* "What hours are you open?"
* "What are the most popular dishes?"
* "What are your prices?"

Your experience becomes a chat with a brand (e.g. https://www.amazon.com/One-Future-Don-Peppers-1993-12-23/dp/B01MZ3QT98/).

Consumer appetite is growing for the UX of knowingly chatting with a bot (in a 1:1 way): https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/business/media/its-not-their-pop-idol-but-a-bot-fans-cheer-anyway.html?_r=0

Bots != an answer with text or a card. It could be a deep link to a [web view](https://medium.com/@vernon99/messenger-bots-decision-trees-vs-webviews-64b36eb0905e).

## 5/ Drift Profiles are v1 of what will be a consumer app that is your personal relationship with brands and businesses.

This should have been the true north for Messenger, but recently they appear distracted feature matching with Snapchat instead of understanding outcomes users want, which has opened up the opportunity for Drift.

Here is my recent Messenger history (it's all with brands / businesses, not individuals). Messenger is starting to become where I store my relationship with brands.

This (search) is going to become really valuable real estate once Drift is the home for your relationships with brands and businesses.

Here's a sample search of me trying to find a business on Messenger :(
