These are the  notes that I have taken from reading [Startup Communities](http://www.amazon.com/Startup-Communities-Building-Entrepreneurial-Ecosystem/dp/1118441540) by Brad Feld. This isn't meant to be a Cliff Notes version or a substitute for reading the book.

Additional notes I've taken while reading other books can be found [here](/book-notes/).

The leading source of job creation in the US comes from young companies starting up, growing and innovating.

Studies show that the geography of innovation is neither democratic nor flat.  This is surprising since you would think that location matters less than ever since information can be sent/received from anywhere (and accessed anywhere).  In theory, the relationship between place and innovation should be lower than ever. However, economic geographers observe the opposite - evidence suggests that location is more important than ever.

## Three frameworks for explaining why some locations become hotbeds for entrepreneurship

- **External or agglomeration economies**: Companies co-located in an area benefit from "external economies of scale" (i.e. emerging companies need common inputs like infrastructure, specialized legal and accounting services, labor pools, etc.) and the fixed costs of these resources is shared.  This also includes network effects where the addition of an additional member to the network enhances the value of the network for existing members.

- **Horizontal Networks**: Network effects are better leveraged by a community with a culture of openness and information sharing across companies / industries (i.e. Silicon Valley companies are able to better share information, adopt new trends, leverage innovation and nimbly respond to new conditions).

- **Creative Class**: Creative Class individuals (entrepreneurs, engineers, professors, artists, etc.) want to live in nice places, enjoy a culture with a tolerance for new ideas and weirdness, and most of all - be around other creative class individuals (another example of network effects).


### The fourth framework is the Boulder Thesis

- Entrepreneurs must lead the startup community. While government, universities, inventors, mentors and service providers are important - they can't be the leaders.
- The leaders must have a long term commitment: 20 years from today (that the commitment resets daily) regardless of the economic cycle their community is currently in.
- The startup community must be inclusive of anyone who wants to participate in it.
- The startup community must have continual activities that engine the entire entrepreneurial stack.

## "High Growth Entrepreneurial Companies" vs "Small Businesses"

Small businesses are local, profitable, slow growth and have a tight co-dependency on their community (and are often "pillars of the community").

Entrepreneurial companies have the potential to be high growth, are only involved in the local community as employers and indirect contributors to small businesses and the local economy but their extreme focus on their companies keeps them from being involved in the broad business community

## The Leaders

There is no "leader of the leaders" - the best startup communities are loosely organized and consist of broad, evolving networks of people.  By having inclusive philosophies, it's easy for new leaders to emerge organically.

Feeders (everyone else) are on different time cycles (e.g. two or four year cycle of the government) or different motivations (i.e. service providers can grow by increasing revenue from clients).  Many entrepreneurs have families and struggle mightily with balancing work and the rest of their life - "leading their startup community" can sound like one more burden on top of an already overwhelming set of responsibilities.  Entrepreneurial leaders need to be inclusive of any feeders that want to participate.

Universities (MIT's close proximity to Cambridge/Boston/Route 128 and Stanford's proximity to Silicon Valley) lead to the belief startup communities are dependent on a university.  Universities provide students, professors, research labs, entrepreneurship programs and technology transfer offices.  They can be a source of fresh blood, new thinking, and additional potential leaders.

## The Mentor Manifesto

- Be socratic
- Expect nothing in return (you'll be delighted with what you do get back)
- Be authentic / practice what you preach
- Be direct. tell the truth, however hard
- Listen too
- The best mentor relationships eventually become two way relationships
- Be responsive
- Adopt at least one company every single year
- Experience counts<
- Clearly separate opinion from fact
- Hold information in confidence
- Clearly commit to mentor or do not - either is fine
- Know what you don't know - say "I don't know" when you don't know
- Guide, don't control. Teams must make their own decisions. Guide but never tell them what to do. Understand that it's their company, not yours.
- Accept and communicate with other mentors that get involved
- Be optimistic
- Provide specific actionable advice, don't be vague
- Be challenging / robust but never destructive
- Have empathy - remember startups are hard

## Attributes of Leadership in a Startup Community

### Be inclusive
Anyone regardless of experience, background, education, ethnicity, or perspective should be welcomed into the startup community.  When someone new shows up at the gates of the startup community, the leaders should make sure the person knows what activities exist to quickly get them involved. If someone is visiting from out of town, the leader should quickly introduce them to about 10 people he thinks are relevant so the visitor can get a bunch of meetings set up to explore the local startup community.

### Play a non-zero sum game

Many people approach business as a zero-sum game - there are winners and there are losers.  Fully embrace the notion of increasing returns (through a more powerful non-zero-sum approach) - the goal of the startup community should be to create something that is durable for a very long time.

### Be Mentorship Driven
Leaders should be focused on mentorship at several levels.  They should be mentoring other leaders, working with anyone who wants to be a leader in the startup community to help them become a leader.  They should mentor other entrepreneurs, especially those early in their careers who are searching for new mentors.  And they should be mentoring each other - because the best mentor relationships turn into peer relationships

### Have Porous Boundaries
It's acceptable for people to flow from one company to another. Leaders talk to each other and share strategies, relationships, ideas and resources.

### Give People Assignments

Use assignments as a filter to find people who will get stuff done (you're being inclusive by people a chance to do something to engage)

### Experiment and Fail Fast
Think of your startup community as a lean startup - try lots of experiments, measure the results, and pivot when things aren't working

## Classic Problems

### (1) The Patriarch Problem

In many cities, these patriarchs are the old white guys who made their money years ago but still run the show.  The leaders of the startup community should simply ignore the patriarchs and do your thing without getting their approval.

### (2) Complaining about Capital

There will always be an imbalance between supply of capital and demand for capital.

### (3) Being too reliant on government

Although government can play a constructive role in startup communities, a reliance on government to either lead or provide key resources for the effort of building a startup community over a long period of time is a misguided view. Government often has less money to apply to things than people think it does.  Most people in the government don't have a history as entrepreneurs and thus don't understand startups in any depth.  Entrepreneurs live in networks - government lives in hierarchy.

### (4) Making short term commitments

The previously mentioned 20 year time frame signifies a generation - it takes a generation of effort to get a startup community up and running in a sustainable way.

### (5) Having a Cultural Risk Aversion

People are afraid of investing time in their startup community because they are afraid there won't be a payoff either (a) their time will be invested in something that doesn't have an impact or (b) fear or rejection by other leads in the startup community

(6) Having a Bias Against Newcomers
(7) Attempt By a Feed to Control the Community
(8) VC's are some of the worst offenders of this
(9) Creating Artificial Geographic Boundaries
(10) Playing a Zero Sum Game
(11) Avoiding People Because of Past Failures


## Activities and Events

- **Office Hours**: One day a month, I'd declare a random day and spend 15 minutes meeting with anyone.
- **Meetups**: Such as Boulder Denver New Tech Meetup (large gathering event)
- **Boulder Open Coffee Club**: A small gathering that isn't special but happens on a regular basis where members of the community interact deeply with one another in an informal setting
- Startup Weekend
- **Ignite Boulder**: Each speaker gets 20 slides to get their point across and those slides automatically advance every 15 seconds
- **Boulder Beta**: Startup showcase
- **Boulder Startup Digest**: Free weekly email that highlights the best startup events for the coming week
- **CU New Venture Challenge**
- **Boulder Startup Week**: Free, decentralized event - no badges, no specific venue and no checking in, the entire event would be one big hallway though the Boulder startup community
- **Entrepreneurs Foundation of Colorado: Volunteer board of local entrepreneurs, service providers, and local community foundation help, we make it easy for startup companies to endow the community.  Typically this means giving approximately 1% of a company's founding equity at a time when the equity is worth almost nothing (a warrant for 1% of the company that is only excercise-able upon change of control through a sale or IPO.
- Also: **TEDx Boulder**, **Boulder Open Angel Forum**, **Boulder Jobs List**, **Startup Colorado**, **TechStars**

## The Power of Accelerators

David Cohen made a few angel investments but wasn't happy with the dynamic of how the entrepreneurs engaged with him and felt his experience was wasted - there must be a better way for experienced entrepreneurs to help companies who were just getting up and running.

TechStars takes simple applications on the web (no business plans), select and fund the best founders who are working in interesting markets and put them together with the best mentors and investors for three months.

The model works because it's focused on the very people (both founders and mentors).

Accelerators and incubators aren't the same thing.  Incubators some characteristics but were originally created to foster economic development - they provide entrepreneurs space, infrastructure and advice in exchange for a fee (which is occasionally paid in part in equity).  Incubators operate year round and continuously.

## University Involvements

Universities are a feeder that, at a minimum, generate a steady stream of new young people into the startup community.

## Contrasts Between Entrepreneurs and Government

A reliance on government is one of the classic problems in startup communities.

Governments can be well intentioned (especially around anything that creates jobs or creates new tax revenue) but the often have no understanding of what entrepreneurs do or the pressure the face.

### Self Aware vs Not Self Aware

Great entrepreneurs are greatly self aware. They know what they are bad at and often describe it as "I suck at X." Government leaders rarely talk this way.  Entrepreneurs fail often and own it; government leaders rationalize why something didn't go their way.  Entrepreneurs are critical of themselves and other and support their viewpoints with data.  Government leaders work to "impact public opinion"

### Bottom up vs Top Down

Entrepreneurs work bottom up and government works top down. When entrepreneurs start a company, they do all of the work without the resources, staff, structure or framework for what they are attempting to do. They just go do it. Government is exactly the opposite - there is a well defined hierarchy, existing infrastructure, staff that persists from one administration to the next and clear rules of engagement for getting things done.

Entrepreneurs operate in a networked world - government operates in a hierarchical world.

Entrepreneurs are hard wired to take action. Government leaders focus on creating policy.

## The Power of the Community

### Give before you get

Always willing to try to be helpful to anyone, without having a clear expectation of what is in it for yourself.

### Everyone is a mentor

The best moment in a mentor-mentee relationship is when the mentor learns as much or more from the mentee. The culture of widely sharing knowledge, experience and expertise is incredibly satisfying and self-reinforcing.  The more you do, the more you'll see others in the community do.

### Embrace weirdness

In his book The Rise of the Creative Class, Richard Florida talks about weirdness as a key attribute of innovative communities. People can be themselves and be accepted for who they are and what they do.

### Be Open to Any Idea

Try anything once, as long as it isn't illegal.  The best way to learn is to try things.  In a hierarchy, the response to a new idea is to start asking questions and figuring out why it won't work. In a network, trying things and running experiments has become synonymous with the learn startup movement.

### Be Honest

Regardless of how you feel about a particular issue, decision or situation, being intellectually honest trumps everything.  You don't get better by people telling you that you are perfect. Someone has to be the asshole.  After the initial shock (of blunt, direct and challenging feedback), it occurs that the feedback was actually constructive and probing (not people trying to knock each other down a peg or two because of low self esteem).

### Go For a Walk

Too many meetings happen in conference rooms. Whenever I (Brad Feld) want to have a long discussion with a CEO or founder who I'm working with, or need to work through something with someone, we often walk a loop around town.

### The Important of the After Party
In many situations, the real party happens after the official party ends.

## Broadening of a Successful Startup Community

Parallel Universes - There are five startup communities of Boulder - software/internet, biotech, clean tech, natural foods and lifestyle of health and sustainability (LOHAS).

## Myths about startup communities

### We need to be more like Silicon Valley

Much of what makes Silicon Valley (or any startup community) work has to do with things that happen below the surface.  It has to do with the permeability of organizational boundaries, continuous collision of young entrepreneurs in a dense urban environment, failing entrepreneurially is accepted in the Valley.

### We need more local venture capital
Startup communities and venture capital aren' t the same.  Venture capital is a service function, not  materially different from accounting, law or insurance.  It services existing businesses - not one that causes companies to exist in the first place.  While businesses need capital, it isn't the capital that creates the business.

### Angel Investors must be organized

Most startup communities feel like they're aren't complete without at least one angel group who meets regularly, screens companies, see pitches and (after group deliberation) invests individually in young companies. These groups may be useful to some angels who may want additional deal flow through these organizations or help someone else to help them through the screening or legal process. Sometimes these angel groups are too slow, aren't active active, complain and have too many processes.

## Getting Started
Scott Case (Startup America Partnership): How does your community stack up?

- **Leadership**: A strong group of entrepreneurs who are visible
- **Intermediaries**: Many well respected mentors and advisors giving back across all stages
- **Network Density**: Deep, well-connected community of startups and entrepreneurs along with engaged and visible investors, advisors, mentors and supporters
- **Government**: Strong government support for and understanding of significance of startups to economic growth (additional supportive policies should be in place covering economic development, tax and investment vehicles)
- **Talent**: Broad, deep talent pool for all levels of employees in all sectors and areas of expertise
- **Support services**: Professional services (legal, accounting, real estate, insurance, consulting) that are integrated and appropriately priced
- **Engagement**: Large number of events for entrepreneurs and the community to connect
- **Companies**: Large companies that are the anchor of a city.
- **Capital**: Strong, dense and supportive community of VC's, angels, seed investors and other forms of financing should be available.
