title: Book Notes
---

I take notes on everything that I think I might want to reference again in the future. Since I already have my notes from books I've read saved digitally, I post them here so hopefully at least one other person can find them useful.

These aren’t meant to be a Cliff’s Notes version or substitute for reading the book. Please support the author(s) and buy a copy of their book(s).
